The Critical Decentralisation Cluster on the [Chaos Communication Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress) is an area and grouping of different "assemblies", which are working together and presenting projects, workshops and a space **to critically discuss the future of decentralisation**.

In the past years the cluster consisted of a recording stage as well as two workshop areas for the assemblies and similar minded groups and projects. Part of the cluster also has been a [coffee area from Paralelni Polis](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmW99U5VvqfX8bxsVnDL4sG4n3p2ZY2Xo5jLkerxwTGqWA/q62LNBE.jpg), as well as a historic overview of “process artefacts” from the RIAT archive.
