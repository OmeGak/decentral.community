In the past years the cluster consisted of a recording stage as well as two workshop areas for the assemblies and similar minded groups and projects. Part of the cluster also has been a [coffee area from Paralelni Polis](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmW99U5VvqfX8bxsVnDL4sG4n3p2ZY2Xo5jLkerxwTGqWA/q62LNBE.jpg), as well as a historic overview of “process artefacts” from the RIAT archive.
