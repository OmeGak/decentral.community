The Critical Decentralisation Cluster at the 37th Chaos Communication Congress (37C3) is an area and grouping of similar minded projects, which are offering workshops and host a space to critically discuss the future of decentralization.

The cluster consists of a recording stage as well as a workshop area for the assemblies and similar minded groups and projects. Part of the cluster is a coffee area, as well as space to hack, work, and learn. Please register in our FRAB to submit content for the cluster: http://frab.riat.at
